Normalizes recorded values from location channel to metric (cm)

input
    prm : object, parameters
    raw_data : array, electrophysiology and movement data file, contains recorded location values

output
    normalized_location_metric : array, contains normalized location values (in cm)

The standardization is computed by finding the minimum and maximum recorded location values (min, max), and then
subtracting min from max, to get the recorded track length (recorded_length). Then, this recorded_length is devided by
the real track length to get the distance unit that will be used for the conversion.

From every recorded location point, the recorded_startpoint (min) value is subtracted to make the first location = 0.
The recorded_startpoint may not be 0 due to the sampling rate. (Please note that this is not the beginning of the
ephys recording in time, but the smallest value recorded by the rotary encoder.) This value is then divided by the
distance unit calculated in the previous step to convert the rotary encoder values to metric.

Corrects for the very small negative values that are calculated as velocity when the mouse 'teleports' back
to the beginning of the track - from the end of the track to 0.

input
    prm : obejct, parameters
    velocity : numpy array, instant velocity

output
    velocity : array, instant velocity without teleport artefacts

It finds the velocity values that are smaller than -track_length+max_velocity, and adds track_length to them. These
values will be around the beginning of the track after the mouse finished the previous trial and jumped back to the
beginning.

After the first iteration, it finds the values that are <-10 (it is highly unlikely for a mouse to have that speed), it
replaces them with the previous location value.

An alternative solution may be to nto analyze this data.
